wvs-argentina-defense-attitudes
===============================

This data set cobbles together attitudes on the importance of defense as national goal in Argentina across a handful waves of World Values Survey data. This data set is meant for classroom instruction on quantitative methods.

Data come from first five waves of World Values Survey. My file dates to September 14, 2009.

Brief codebook (variable of origin in WVS in parentheses): 

- wvsccode (s003): 32 (for Argentina)
- wave (s002): 1-5 (1984, 1991, 1995, 1999, 2006).
- aims.defense (e001): 1 = aims of country should be "strong defense force". 0 = something else (i.e. "high level of economic growth", "people have more say about how things are done", or "making our cities more beautiful"). Only asked since second wave.
- age (x003): age in years. No clue why this is missing for observations in 1984.
- collegeed (x025): did respondent graduate from college?
- female (x001): women = 1. men = 0
